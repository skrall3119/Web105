                <p style=" color: #FFF958"><i class="material-icons">filter_drama</i> As far back as I can remember, art was always my escape. My way to convey my emotions without "talking about it". Art is my outlet to show people no matter what age you are, you can deal with extremely life changing situations. But more importantly, that you can survive those tough times and grow from your experiences. As you may notice, I don't limit myself to only one art form. I dabble in many different aspects of art. One of the most fulfilling things I have found while trying different types of art, is that each form brings a different type of relief for me. And to me that's what art is all about, expressing yourself in a positive way as a release leaving a beautiful outcome. As a disclaimer, I would like to mention that most of my art is extremely deep as well as personal to myself as a person. I take my life events and put them into art to create a piece of me that others can enjoy and appreciate. One thing that I really relied on as a child was the fact that with a drawing or a piece of art, is that it can be interpreted, but nothing is for certain. This being said I used drawing in the same way that many others use diaries, I take my troubles and I put them on paper, but not in words. I'm glad to say that I still have most of my sketch books from my childhood, and now and again I look back and think about how I dealt with the situation at that time.</p>
